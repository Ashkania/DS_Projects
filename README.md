## Project 1: Classification
• Hiring and retaining employees are extremely complex tasks that
require capital, time and skills.<br>
• “Small business owners spend 40% of their working hours on tasks
that do not generate any income such as hiring”.<br>
• “Companies spend 15%-20% of the employee's salary to recruit a
new candidate”.<br>
• “An average company loses anywhere between 1% and 2.5% of their
total revenue on the time it takes to bring a new hire up to speed”.<br>
• Hiring a new employee costs an average of $7645 (0-500 corporation).<br>
• It takes 52 days on average to fill a position. You work as a
data scientist at a multinational corporation.<br>
• The HR team collected extensive data on their employees and
approached you to develop a model that could predict which employees
are more likely to quit.<br>

• The team provided us with an extensive data, here's a sample of
the dataset:

o JobInvolvement<br>
o Education<br>
o JobSatisfaction<br>
o PerformanceRating<br>
o RelationshipSatisfaction<br>
o WorkLifeBalance<br>

## Project 2: Clustering

* Marketing is crucial for the growth and sustainability of any business.
* Marketers can help build the company’s brand, engage customers, grow revenue, and increase sales.
* One of the key pain points for marketers is to know their customers and identify their needs.
* By understanding the customer, marketers can launch a targeted marketing campaign that is tailored for specific needs.
* If data about the customers is available, data science can be applied to perform market segmentation.
* In this case study, we have extensive data of a bank in New York City on their customers for the past 6 months. 
* The marketing team at the bank wants to launch a targeted ad marketing campaign by dividing their customers into at least 3 distinctive groups.  

dataset includes:

o BALANCE<br>
o BALANCE_FREQUENCY<br>
o PURCHASES<br>
o INSTALLMENTS_PURCHASES<br>
o CASH_ADVANCE<br>
o PURCHASES_FREQUENCY<br>
o PURCHASES_INSTALLMENTS_FREQUENCY<br>
